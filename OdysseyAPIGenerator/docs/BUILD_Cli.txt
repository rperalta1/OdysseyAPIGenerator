Building the Shared Library from Command Line Interface
=======================================================

Pre-requisites
--------------
Java 10 (we have tested with jdk-10.0.2; other jdk versions may work but are untested) and Apache Maven 3.5.2 
(the version we have tested; other versions may work but are untested) must be installed before you execute the next procedure.

Install procedure
-----------------

1) Copy the Odyssey API XSD files: create a directory on your hard drive which contains Tyler's Odyssey API XSD files. 
   As a convention, use the year of the Odyssey (major) release that you have installed as the name of the directory. 
   For instance if you are using Odyssey v.2017 XSD files create directory c:/tmp/2017 

2) Configure pom.xml files for your environment
   
   a) Open the pom.xml file located in the parent-project directory. Line 16, variable <dir.init>, defines where XSD files are
   stored; use the directory created in step 1 to configure this parameter. On lines 17 and 18, the variables <odyssey.api.wsdl>
   and <odyssey.ixml.wsdl> define urls where Tyler's Odyssey API web service definitions (i.e. wsdls) are available. Modify these URLs
   as appropriate for your Odyssey installation/environment. When you are finished with these changes, save the modified pom.xml file.   

   b) Change your current working directory to parent-project/OdyApiGen-Library, inside this directory you must edit
   another pom.xml file. Line 13 defines a variable <version>. Use the parameter you defined in step 1. For instance, if you are
   working with 2017 XSD files then write <version>2017</version>; save the file after you have completed this edit.
   
   c) Like in the previous step, change your working directory to parent-project/OdyApiGen-Example, where you will find another pom.xml 
   file, and open it. Find line 38 and update the value of the variable version. Again, use the information from step 1, and save the 
   pom.xml file.

3) Building the shared library

   From a terminal or command line interface go to directory parent-project and execute the following to maven commands:
       mvn clean install
    or       
       mvn clean
       mvn install

   The pom.xml located inside the parent-project will execute two maven (sub)modules: ody_api_gen_builder and ody_api_gen_library.
   The resulting shared library (JAR file) will be placed inside parent-project/OdyApiGen-Library/target and it will also be 
   installed in the local maven repository of the computer where you are creating the shared library. Please note that this generated jar
   file contains only the shared library, and the next section describes how to run an example program which demonstrates usage of the 
   shared library. 

4) Using the shared library
   
   Examples for demonstrating how to use the library are included in this project. To run them, from the command line / terminals,
   change the current working directory to parent-project/OdyApiGen-Example folder and execute the following commands:
      mvn clean compile exec:java
    or      
      mvn clean
      mvn compile exec:java   
   
   Notice that the example is using the JAR file (shared library) created in step 3 (from your local maven repository).  

Notes
-----
   - The shared library generated by this procedure in the parent-project/OdyApiGen-Library/target folder can be copied to other
     projects and included in the build path of the project like any other JAR file. Alternatively, you can use it in your maven (or other)
     repository and include it as a dependency from other projects.
   - When the OdyApiGen-Example runs a window will be presented in order to setup the parameters of the program. You must provide the Odyssey 
     API wsdl URL, the Odyssey site id, the user id -- a number associated to the user account that is running the program (user ids can be found 
     on Operations.dbo.AppUser table of your Odyssey DB), and a valid Odyssey case number that has at least one case event linked to a pdf 
     document.
